Introduction to OS, Chapter 02

Read [Introduction to OS](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/intro.pdf) and answer the following review questions.

1. **What is an operating system? What does it do?** Operating system is software body, which makes easy to runing programs. 
2. **What is virtualization?** Transforming physical resourse into virtual form.
3. **How does an OS provide access to its features?** your answer goes here 
4. **What illusion does a virtualized CPU provide?** When several commands are executed at the same time, with help from hardware
    - **How does this affect the user experience?** their randomly run on user interface 
    - **How does this affect the developer experience?** your answer goes here 
    - **What if the CPU were not virtualized?** we cannot allowing many programs to seemingly run at once  
5. **What is a memory address?** fixed-length sequences of digits conventionally displayed 
6. **What is memory virtualization?** when the program supposedly has a different virtual memory address, but the physical memory is one
    - **Why would we want this?** A reference to memory within
one running program does not affect the space of other processes
8. **What happens if you write a C/C++ program that writes past the end of an array?**  your answer goes here
      - **Can this affect other programs?** your answer goes here 
9. **What is a thread?** function that works in the same memory space as other functions, with
more than one of them is active at the same time.
10. **Why would we ever write a multi-threaded program?** your answer goes here
11. **What is atomicity?** your answer goes here
    - **Is a C/C++ statement atomic?** your answer goes here 
    - **Is a Java statement atomic?** your answer goes here 
    - **Is an assembler statement atomic?** your answer goes here 

13. **What does persistence mean?** your answer goes here

14. **How does OS hard drive virtualization differ from CPU & memory virtualization?** your answer goes here 
15. **How does running multiple programs at the same time increase CPU efficiency?** your answer goes here 
16. **What is multiprogramming?** your answer goes here
